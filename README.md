1. Initial Welcome and Setup: - The user (patient) logs into the therapy platform and is greeted by the chatbot with a friendly introduction. - The chatbot gathers initial details, such as the patient’s name and therapy goals, and offers a brief overview of its features (e.g., exercise suggestions, Q&A, and progress tracking). 
2. Understanding Patient Needs: - The chatbot starts by asking a few questions to understand the patient’s current needs, such as, “How are you feeling today?” or “What specific speech sound or exercise would you like to work on?” - Based on the patient’s response, the chatbot tailors its recommendations, suggesting specific articulation exercises, relaxation techniques, or conversation practice activities.
3. Guided Exercises and Activities: - The user selects an exercise to work on (e.g., practicing the ‘r’ sound), and the chatbot provides step-by-step instructions, including text-based guidance and visual/audio cues. - As the patient completes the exercise, the chatbot listens to their responses (if voice input is enabled) and provides real-time feedback on articulation, pronunciation, and fluency. 
4. Simulating Therapy Sessions: - The chatbot simulates a short therapy session by asking the patient questions, offering prompts, and engaging in role-playing activities. - For example, the chatbot might role-play a conversation to help the patient practice responding to various questions, using new vocabulary, or maintaining fluency.
5. Providing Feedback and Encouragement: - At the end of each exercise or activity, the chatbot summarizes the patient’s performance, highlights areas of improvement, and offers encouragement. - The chatbot might say, “Great job on the ‘s’ sound today! I noticed some improvement in your pronunciation. Let’s keep working on this sound in the next few sessions.” 
6. Answering Therapy-Related Questions: - The user can ask the chatbot questions about their therapy progress, session details, or therapy goals. - The chatbot answers questions like, “What progress have I made so far?” or “How many sessions are left in my current plan?” 
7. Session Summary and Documentation: - After the interaction, the chatbot generates a summary of the session, documenting what was practiced, feedback provided, and recommendations for the next session. - This summary is saved in the user’s profile and shared with the therapist, helping to maintain a comprehensive record of the patient’s progress.
